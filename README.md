# Radiant Restyles
*Radiant Restyles* is simply a little project where I alter the base game sprites; all that you'll need to do to 'install' the mod is to download PNGs and put them in the sprite folder.

## Radiant Restyles: Eyes
*Radiant Restyles: Eyes* will host all my sprite edits for `eyes`, and will kept up to date with current releases. No promises for the dev release, but I might end up doing them in the end. All eyes are shaded according to my art style.
