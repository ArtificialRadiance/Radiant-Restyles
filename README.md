# Radiant Restyles
*Radiant Restyles* is simply a small collection of ClanGen mods where I alter the base game sprites; all that you'll need to do to 'install' the mod is to download PNGs and put them in the sprite folder.

Anything in the same category (i.e., `Retro` and `Wide-Eyed` in *Radiant Restyles: Eyes*) will not be compatible together, as they have the same file names.

## How to Install
- Download the given files in a branch (each branch is labeled with what sprite sets they are, be sure to check the tables in the `main` branch).
- Unzip the folder in your downloads.
- Drag the image files into the `sprites` folder of Clan Gen to replace the files of the same name.
- ***These will replace the original files of the same name; if you want to return to defaults, remember to save a copy of the png files in a different, accessable folder.***
- You are free to play the game as usual

## Radiant Restyles: Eyes
*Radiant Restyles: Eyes* will host all my sprite edits for `eyes`, and will kept up to date with current releases. No promises for the dev release, but I might end up doing them in the end. All eyes are shaded according to my art style.
| Name | Description | Progress |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Retro | *Retextures vanilla colors to be similar to classic WC art styles of old; It makes the whites a more yellow color while the pupils are showing the true color.* | Completed |
| Wide-Eyed | *Retextures vanilla colors to look a little more “cartoony”. Pupils are made black while the whites are showing the true color.* | Started |
| Spider Gaze | *Retextures vanilla sprites to add multiple eyes on the head. Perfect for spookiness and fantasy if you want spidery cats. Will come in 2 versions; the one here will replace only vanilla eyes.* | Not Started |
| Multigaze | *Retextures vanilla sprites to add multiple eyes along the body. Perfect for spookiness and fantasy if you want eldritch-looking cats. Will come in 2 versions; the one here will replace only vanilla eyes. Inspired by Flight Rising.* | Not Started |
